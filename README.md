Creating a simple Audiomack-like web application with Firebase and hosting it on GitHub involves several steps. Audiomack is a music streaming platform, so our simplified version will allow users to upload and listen to audio tracks. Below is a high-level description of the process:

Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools and services installed and configured:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
Firebase account and Firebase CLI
GitHub account and Git installed
A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

Step 2: Create a Firebase Project
